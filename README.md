LMS7002M Documentation 
======================

The LMS7002M is Lime’s second-generation field programmable RF (FPRF) transceiver IC, with extended functionality to cover a greater range of frequencies and applications.

The device uses state of the art transceiver design in CMOS technology to significantly reduce cost and power consumption. It integrates a dual transceiver architecture to support 2×2 MIMO along with on-chip digital signal processing functions. The LMS7002M can run on any mobile communications and wireless standard – including all 2G, 3G and 4G variants and WiFi – both licensed and unlicensed.

Summary of features:

* Field Programmable Radio Frequency (FPRF) chip
* Dual transceiver ideal for MIMO
* User programmable on the fly
* Continuous coverage of the 100kHz-3.8GHz RF frequency range
* Digital interface to baseband with on chip integrated 12 bit D/A and A/D converters
* Programmable RF modulation bandwidth up to 120MHz using analog interface
* Programmable RF modulation bandwidth up to 56MHz using digital interface
* Supports both TDD and full duplex FDD
* LimeLight™ digital IQ interface – JEDEC JESD207 TDD and FDD compliant
* Transceiver Signal Processor block employs advanced techniques for enhanced performance
* Single chip supports 2×2 MIMO. Multiple chips can be used to implement higher order MIMO
* On-chip RF calibration circuitry
* Fully differential baseband signals, analog IQ
* Few external components
* Low voltage operation, 1.25, 1.4 and 1.8V. Integrated LDOs to run on a single 1.8V supply voltage
* On chip integrated microcontroller for simplified calibration, tuning and control
* Integrated clock PLL for flexible clock generation and distribution
* User definable analog and digital filters for customised filtering
* RF and base band Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
* 261pin aQFN 11.5×11.5 mm package
* Power down option
* Serial port interface
* Low power consumption, typical 880mW in full 2×2 MIMO mode (550mW in SISO mode) using external LDOs
* Multiple bypass modes for greater flexibility
